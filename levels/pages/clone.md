Welcome to `make-git-better` CTF ðŸš©

This is the first level of the challenge. You need to `clone` a repository using `ssh`. The server is `localhost`, the user is `gamemaster`, and the repository's path on the server is `~/ctf-repo`.

Once you've done this, read the `README.md` file in the repository to see what you need to do to get to the next level - `start-here`.

Good luck!
