Welcome to `make-git-better` CTF ðŸš©

This is the first level of the challenge. You need to `clone` a repository using `ssh`. The server is `localhost`, the user is `gamemaster`, and the repository's path on the server is `~/ctf-repo`. So that means you need to run the following command:

```sh
git clone gamemaster@localhost:~/ctf-repo
```

Once you've done this, run `cd ctf-repo` to change the working directory to the cloned repository. You should see changes in your shell (like `master`). It should look something like this:

Finally, read the `README.md` file to see what you need to do to get to the next level - `start-here`.

Good luck!
