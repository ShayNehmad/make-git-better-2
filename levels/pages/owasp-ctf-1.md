This level was a part of OWASP CTF 2020.

{{< levelgraph >}}

The focus of this level is AppSec, and specifically, `git` security. But not
`git` fundamentals, like the rest of the levels in this CTF. So you should
_probably_ solve the rest of the levels first.

[~~Click here~~](https://appsecil2020.ctf.today/). In the past, this link worked.
The CTF is over now, so it doesn't work anymore. Here are the instructions to
start:

`git checkout headmistresses-tiptoes-bezzled`.
