![who's on first?](/images/whos-on-first.gif "who's on first?")

In this level, the commits are all out of order. Reorder them using an
interactive rebase, and push them in the correct order.

In case you've never watch the classic sketch "Who's on First?", The correct
order is:

> First base: Who
>
> Second base: What
>
> Third base: I Don't Know

(By the way, if you haven't watched it, you should. It's a classic.)

pushing content to this branch right now...

You need to force push. Why? Because you're rewriting history. And that's OK.

`git push --force-with-lease`. See [the documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push#Documentation/git-push.txt---no-force-with-lease).
